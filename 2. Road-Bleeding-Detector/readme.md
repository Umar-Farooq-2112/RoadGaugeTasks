## Introduction
Road bleeding refers to the appearance of dark spots or patches on road surfaces, typically due to the excessive application of asphalt or tar. This project aims to automate the detection of these bleeding spots using image processing techniques.

## Features
- **Detection of dark spots:** Identify and draw bounding boxes around road bleeding spots.
- **Preprocessing:** Handle various image challenges such as noise, tilt, and lighting conditions.
- **Customization:** Adjustable parameters for detection sensitivity and preprocessing.

## Installation
To use this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Umar-Farooq-2112/Road-Bleeding-Detector.git
cd Road-Bleeding-Detector
pip install numpy
pip install opencv-python
```
